# ScrapySwarm

* Messy spiders crawl sorts of china news websites, based on Python Scrapy frame. 
  * This proj is serves for a web data analysing proj as a base module.
* It's a remote cooperative practice project, so I can't guarantee that every spider works well. 
  * It may contains code which copied from anywhere, even without a valid licence.
* Our team's git server still not ready, so this proj is a temp storing place.
* Whether the comment and sign is provided or not depends on the mood of the coder at the time.
* But I'll try my best to standardize this proj with my buddy.  
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
