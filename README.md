# ScrapySwarm

* Messy spiders crawl news.sina.com.cn, news.qq.com, chinanews.com, weibo.cn, based on Python Scrapy frame. 
  * This proj is serves for a web data analysing proj as a base module.
* It's a remote cooperative practice project, so I can't guarantee that every spider works well. 
  * It may contains code which copied from anywhere, even without a valid licence.
  * Few comments in the code. 
* Our team's git server looks like it will never be ready, so I persuaded the same group to use at least github.
* Documents and notes are mostly Chinese.
* But I'll try my best to standardize this proj with my buddy.  
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
